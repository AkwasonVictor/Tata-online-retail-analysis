#CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Analysis conducted has shown areas in which our strength and weakness lies, the months in which our focus should be drawn to.
In other to improve revenue on months and countries that revenue generation is low, we could focus on choosing the type of product to sell at that time and place.
Furthermore, countries with high/saturated demand, could need expansion by opening new stores, for countries with low demands, marketing efforts should be channeled towards these countries.
